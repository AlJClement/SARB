#DATA Inputs
data:
  #This code is designed to start with mat dir and loop to get all the data, any scans in that folder will be used in the analysis.
  #scans are loaded into a dataloader for organization.
  mat_dir: '/Users/allison/Desktop/data' #directory of mat files.

  #Annotations are in yolo format and put all in one flat directory. They should have the same name as the mat_dir name with '_boundingbox.txt' at the end of the name.
  annotation_dir: '/Users/allison/Desktop/data/ROI_annotations' 
  #max number of annotations, for dataloader, anything else will be all zeros but allows this to keep the same shape for data loader purposes
  max_annotations: 20

  #visuals are created if the images are loaded, and features are calculated.
  visuals: 
    - orig_cache #original files, each channel plotted
  img_scale: [1,1,1,1,1] #scales each channel FOR VISUALS - given by Mihoko
  set_max: [255,10,10,10,255] #set max for each channel to allow for easy visualisation
  set_max_feat: [1,1,1,1,1] #set max value for features for visualization
  dpi: 1000 #save image quality
  normalize: False
  
  batch_size: 1 #will load each file into the data loader as 1 sample

  ## define the disease and control as the folders 
  control: 'Cont'
  disease: 'PAN'

  #Resample will resample the images from the original size [2048,2048] to the size below. Smaller samplings allow for easier computations but we loose some info in resampling.
  resample: None # [256,256] #this is the size the image will be resampled for feature calculations.
  resample_roi: 256 #will after crop resample image size

  #If you want to split the image into a grid, setting this value will crop the image into patches of these sizes during data loading and save them each as a sample.
  patch_size: None #224 #None #256 #8  #either gets s


### FEATURE EXTRACTION DEFINITION
feature_extraction:
  load_existing: False #'/Users/allison/Desktop/data/features/HOG'  
  #if this is true you dont need the images to be loaded ** avoid time consuming step.
  #if you want to create extraction set this to False.

  load_images: True 
  #must be set to True if you are doing feature extraction
  #saves alot of time if you are not calculating features again

  #if you have annotations you can separate them by making the separate classes
  separate_classes: True #false if you want entire image
  anatomy_class: 0
  feature_classnames: ['Inner','Outer','Glo']

  #choose the method, see notes for details about the end of the document about potential feature extraction methods and how they differ in inputs required.
  method: SkIMG
  features:
    - GABOR
  
  gabor_frequency: 0.2

  plot: True

  #comparison of features, depends on feature.
  compare:  ['histogram_per_img','run_PCA']
  #define axis for histogram visuals
  histogram_max_y: 2000
  histogram_max_x: 4
  histogram_max_y_channels: 400
  histogram_max_x_channels: 10
  bins: 150
