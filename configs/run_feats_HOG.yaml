#DATA Inputs
data:
  #This code is designed to start with mat dir and loop to get all the data, any scans in that folder will be used in the analysis.
  #scans are loaded into a dataloader for organization.
  mat_dir: '/Users/allison/Desktop/data' #directory of mat files.

  #Annotations are in yolo format and put all in one flat directory. They should have the same name as the mat_dir name with '_boundingbox.txt' at the end of the name.
  annotation_dir: '/Users/allison/Desktop/data/clinican_annotations' 
  #max number of annotations, for dataloader, anything else will be all zeros but allows this to keep the same shape for data loader purposes
  max_annotations: 10

  #visuals are created if the images are loaded, and features are calculated.
  visuals: 
    - orig_cache #original files, each channel plotted
  img_scale: [1,1,1,1,1] #scales each channel FOR VISUALS - given by Mihoko
  set_max: [255,10,10,10,255] #set max for each channel to allow for easy visualisation
  set_max_feat: [1,1,1,1,1] #set max value for features for visualization
  dpi: 1000 #save image quality
  normalize: True
  
  batch_size: 1 #will load each file into the data loader as 1 sample

  ## define the disease and control as the folders 
  control: 'Cont'
  disease: 'PAN'

  #Resample will resample the images from the original size [2048,2048] to the size below. Smaller samplings allow for easier computations but we loose some info in resampling.
  resample: [256,256] #[256,256] #this is the size the image will be resampled for feature calculations.

  #If you want to split the image into a grid, setting this value will crop the image into patches of these sizes during data loading and save them each as a sample.
  patch_size: None #224 #None #256 #8 


### FEATURE EXTRACTION DEFINITION
feature_extraction:
  load_existing: False #'/Users/allison/Desktop/data/features/HOG'  
  #if this is true you dont need the images to be loaded ** avoid time consuming step.
  #if you want to create extraction set this to False.

  load_images: True 
  #must be set to True if you are doing feature extraction
  #saves alot of time if you are not calculating features again

  #if you have annotations you can separate them by making the separate classes
  separate_classes: True #false if you want entire image
  anatomy_class: 1
  feature_classnames: ['Glo', 'Prox', 'Distal']
  #select which class to run 1 is glomerulus and 0 when class is renal tubes for ORIGINAL Semgenations
  #clinicans have defined 0 Glo 1 Prox and 2 Distal which will be used from now on as per below.

  # From Doctor Matsui.
  #'' After consulting with Dr. Shimano last week, we decided that for tubular
  # regions, we would only annotate areas where the tubules are cleanly
  # cross-sectioned rather than those that are obliquely sectioned.
  # Additionally, we agreed to distinguish between "proximal tubules" and
  # "distal tubules/cortical collecting ducts" in our annotations.

  # Therefore, the attached files contain the following labels:

  # 0. Glo (glomeruli)
  # 1. Prox (proximal tubules)
  # 2. Distal (distal tubules/cortical collecting ducts) ''
  
  #choose the method, see notes for details about the end of the document about potential feature extraction methods and how they differ in inputs required.
  method: SkIMG
  features:
    - HOG
  
  #HOG Specific information see documentation.
  orientations: 9
  pixels_per_cell: 8 #assumes cubic shape
  cells_per_block: 4 #assumes cubic shape
  hog_intensity_rescale: 1 #0.1 #for visuals, rescale

  plot: True

  #comparison of features, depends on feature.
  compare:  ['histogram_per_img','run_PCA']
  #define axis for histogram visuals
  histogram_max_y: 25000
  histogram_max_x: 10
  histogram_max_y_channels: 1500
  histogram_max_x_channels: 50
  bins: 150


  #histogram per image
  #this can only be done if we have a feature per pixel of the image.
  #plots features generated for each image (or bounding box) as a histogram and overlays the histograms.
  #means for control vs disease are plotted along with t-stat,m-stat for comparison.

  #run_PCA
  #Flattens disease and healthy features, compares using top two principal components.
